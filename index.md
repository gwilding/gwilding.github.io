# About me

I'm currently finishing my PhD at the [Kapteyn Astronomical Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/kapteyn/) and the [Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/).

My PhD project is set at the interdisciplinary [DSSC](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/themes/dssc/) - the Data Science and Systems Complexity centre - and I'm investigating the large-scale structure in the Universe (the *cosmic web*) using topological data analysis. I have so far [published](https://gwilding.github.io/pubs.html) one paper during my PhD, with three more still in preperation (and two ealier ones from research related my Master's thesis). I also illustrate a view key concepts of my research on my [github](https://github.com/gwilding):

* Topological data analysis (under construction)
* [The topology of Î›CDM cosmologies](https://github.com/gwilding/cosmicwebpersistence)
* [Void exploration using persistence](https://github.com/gwilding/voidshape)

I also presented my work at a few [events](https://gwilding.github.io/talks.html) (in the last two years mostly online unfortunately, but this some of my talks were recorded and you can check them out), and I was the TA for Astrophysical Hydrodynamics.
